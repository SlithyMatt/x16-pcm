CONCLUSION: The extreme high and low bitrates are unusable for the X16 
PCM, even if the actual hardware plays them back perfectly. But, there
is a "sweet spot" between 4 and 12 kHz where very short samples don't 
take up too much memory and have adequate quality for sound effects 
including brief speech samples. Reproducing music entirely with PCM is 
not really workable, but you could certainly use things like drum 
samples to fill out FM or PSG synthesized tracks.
